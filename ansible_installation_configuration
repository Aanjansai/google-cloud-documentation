************************************************************** Ansible **********************************************************************

NOTE: Any server that has an ssh port can be configured by an Ansible machine.

Steps for installing and configuring Ansible on Ubuntu are as follows:

step 1. Make sure your Ubuntu machine is up to date with latest packages:

	$ sudo apt-get update

step 2. Now we will install the Ansible PPA repository on the system using below command:

	$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible

step 3. Install ansible after successfully adding the ansible ppa repository:

	$ sudo apt-get install ansible

step 4. Check for ansible version after installation is done:

	$ ansible --version

step 5. Generate ssh key in the ansible machine, which we have to copy to all 
	the remote hosts for doing deployments or configurations on them:

	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C “hostname@ip_address”

step 6. Copy the ssh key generated to the remote host using the below command.

NOTE: Before copying the ssh key make sure that you are able to ssh the remote host where you want to copy the key.

	$ ssh-copy-id hostname@ip_address

step 7. Now we need to edit the “hosts” file of ansible by specifying the group of servers/remote hosts 
	which we need to connect and perform operations on:

	$ sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts

Add the servers as highlighted below:

NOTE: [test-servers] is the group-name I have given, which will refer to all the servers listed under it :

Example: 

[test-server]
host_1
host_2
host_3
.
.
.
.
.
host_n

step 8. Now as we have setup our “hosts” file and other configurations are done, let’s try a very simple ansible command, 
	which will ping all the servers listed in the “hosts” file:

	$ ansible all -m ping

NOTE:
	“all” means all hosts

	“-m” stands for module

	“ping” is one of the module of ansible


Wola!!!!!!!!…… we have successfully installed and configure Ansible on Ubuntu machine...
